## About Me
Hi! I'm [Pranoy](https://prydt.xyz/), an undergraduate senior currently working with Dr. Vijay Chidambaram and Dr. Shravan Narayan on speeding up interprocess communication on Linux. This is my 4th time running the distributed systems reading group! (You can find the previous lists [here](https://github.com/prydt/dist-sys-reading-group/blob/main/previous-groups.md).)

I became interested in distributed systems after I learned about CRDTs and found the "CALM Theorem." Now I am interested in the intersection between distributed systems and programming language design: how can we enforce certain distributed systems guarantees at a language level? Let me know what parts of distributed systems interest you and we can focus on what y'all are interested in.
