## About Me
Hi! I'm Pranoy, an undergraduate senior currently working with Dr. Vijay Chidambaram and Dr. Shravan Narayan. This is my 4th time running the reading group. (You can find the previous lists [here](https://github.com/prydt/dist-sys-reading-group/blob/main/previous-groups.md).) I became interested in distributed systems after I learned about CRDTs and found the "CALM Theorem." Now I am interested in the intersection between distributed systems and programming language design: how can we enforce certain distributed systems guarantees at a language level?
